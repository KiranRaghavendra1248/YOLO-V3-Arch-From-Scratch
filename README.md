# Yolo v3 object detection model (Pytorch):
Run the yolo object detection algorithm with the below command:
```bash
python detect.py --images test_images --det output
```
Here test_images is the path to dir where the test images are stored and output is the name of dir where we want result images to be stored.

Preferred format for the images is .png
